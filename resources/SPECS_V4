QATE 4.0 SPECIFICATIONS
=======================

* Inclusion of spread data inside both storage and evaluations.

* Change sequencial processing of values for evaluation functions: 
  needs something more robust involving usage of thread-safe queues (real mode only, because now bt is single threaded)

* When in real mode, make the eval threads wait (1 - processing time) instead of one pure second, 
  nowait if processing time > 1s

* Implementation of Neural network functions inside the strat lib ( develop a special backtest mode ?)
