Stock market sentiment analysis with Alchemy API
------------------------------------------------

In this example we will use the Alchemy API service to evaluate the overall sentiment of the US equity market using the content provided by the Wall-Street Journal RSS feed.

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <iostream>
  #include <quotek/alchemy.hpp>
  #include <quotek/datasources/rss.hpp>

  int main() {

    int pos_sent = 0;
    int neg_sent = 0;

    /* we declare a new AlchemyAPI client object. 
     * Here we must provide the Alchemy API-key and API endpoint. 
     */

    quotek::ml::alchemy a1("DKJSKSJD-OIEEOIDJS-LQKSLQSKQLS","http://access.alchemyapi.com");

    /* we declare a new RSS data source, with the WSJ rss feed url as argument */

    quotek::datasource::rss s1("http://www.wsj.com/xml/rss/3_7031.xml");

    /* we fetch the last WSJ market news in the feed */
    std::vector<quotek::data::news> wsj_nlist = s1.fetch(5);

    for (int i=0;i< wsj_nlist.size();i++) {

      /* we send each news to the Alchemy API service for sentiment analysis. */
      quotek::ml::sentiment sent = a1.sentiment( wsj_nlist[i].content,"","text");

      if (sent.sentimentstr == "positive") pos_sent++;
      else if (sent.sentimentstr == "negative") neg_sent++;

    }

    if ( pos_sent > neg_sent ) {
     std::cout << "sentiment on US markets is positive overall" << std::endl;
     /* .. take decision here */
    }

    else {
      std::cout << "sentiment on US markets is negative overall" << std::endl;
      /* .. take another decision here */
    }
  }


Moving Averages evolution on multiple time scales
-------------------------------------------------

For this example we will try to deduce buy and sell signals for an asset by using 2 SMA20 moving averages on 50seconds and 15minutes time scales.

Predicates
^^^^^^^^^^

  * If the 2 moving averages go up at the same time, then we might have a buy signal. 
  * On the other side if they both go down at the same time we may have a sell signal.
  * If the 2 moving average don't go the same way, then we have no signal at all.
  
Also in order see some things, we will simulate a full day of dow-jones quotation by using a random, normally distributed sample (17000, sigma of 100).

.. highlight ::c++

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <quotek/record.hpp>
  #include <quotek/generators.hpp>
  #include <quotek/quant.hpp>
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {

    quotek::data::records current;

    /* we generate a full day of fake Dow-Jones quotations, which represents about 25000 ticks of 1 second */
    quotek::data::records dquotes = quotek::rand::generators::normal(25000, 17000, 100);

    /* Next we'll simulate the running of the quotation day */
    for (int i=0;i< dquotes.size(); i++) {

      current.append(dquotes[i]);

      /* We compute the 2 moving average every 10 ticks */
      if ( i % 10 == 0  ) {

        //we down-sample current for 15-minute ticks
        quotek::data::records current_ds1 = current.down_sample(900,1,"typical");

        //we down-sample current for 50secs ticks.
        quotek::data::records current_ds2 = current.down_sample(50,1,"typical");

        //we compute 20 periods SMA for 15 minutes sample
        std::vector<quotek::data::record> avg1 = quotek::quant::SMA(current_ds1.get_data(),20);

        //we compute 20 periods SMA for 50 seconds sample
        std::vector<quotek::data::record> avg2 = quotek::quant::SMA(current_ds2.get_data(),20);

        if (  percent_delta(avg1) > 0 && percent_delta(avg2) > 0 ) {
          std::cout << "We got a BUY Signal at " << dquotes[i].value << "!" << std::endl;
          // .. We get a potential buy signal, do something..
        }

        else if ( percent_delta(avg1) < 0 && percent_delta(avg2) < 0 ) {
          std::cout << "We got a SELL Signal at " << dquotes[i].value << "!" << std::endl;
          // .. We get a potential sell signal at, do something..
        }
      }
    }
  }
