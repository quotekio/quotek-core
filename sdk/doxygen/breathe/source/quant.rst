The quant functions gather all that is necessary to process your time-series data from a statistical point of view, to help build
your own, accurate forecasting models. The following toolbox constitute the basic set of functions that a developer needs to masterize when it comes to creating 
algorithmic trading strategies.

The quant namespace also includes a basic options pricing model, based on the Black & Scholes formula and its multiple derivates,
and time-series random generators as well.
