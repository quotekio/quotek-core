In the Quotek SDK, Data source modules are the ones that will enable you to import Data from many different locations. Theses locations can be local, remote or cloud services, depending on the module you are using to import your data. So far most of the source modules are for external data services (cloud), but some other remote connectors like Kdb+, ODBC, HDF5 and hadoop will follow soon.
