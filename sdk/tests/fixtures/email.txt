Built-in chat, keyboard shortcuts, customized addresses and more. Sound
cool? We think so too. Welcome to Gmail.

We hope this email will help you learn about some of the features that make
Gmail unique. To get started, you may want to:

   - Check out the Gmail
Tour<http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tour/start.html>in our Getting
   Started section <http://mail.google.com/mail/help/start.html>.
   - Import your
contacts<http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=8301>to
Gmail from Yahoo! Mail, Outlook, Hotmail and others.
   - Visit our Help Center <http://mail.google.com/support/> to learn
   about Gmail's features, like free POP access.

Gmail has super-fast mobile access, and it also works great with other
Google products like Desktop <http://desktop.google.com> for offline
searching, Picasa <http://picasa.google.com> for sending your
pictures, and Google
Talk <http://www.google.com/talk/> for making free calls and sending instant
messages to your friends.

As you're using Gmail, you might notice that there aren't any large,
blinking, irrelevant ads. That's because we only show small text ads that
are matched by computers and designed to be relevant to the messages you're
viewing.

Users have often told us that the more they use Gmail, the more they
discover its added benefits. So go ahead and give Gmail a try. We'll keep
working on making Gmail the best email service around. Thanks for joining us
for the ride. We hope you'll enjoy Google's approach to email.

Thanks,

The Gmail Team
