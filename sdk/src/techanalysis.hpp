    /** MACD is an early trend indicator. It is composed of 2 graph lines. The first line, MACD, is a difference between an EMA small period and an EMA long period.
     *  the second line, the signal line, is usually a 9 periods EMA.
     *  When the MACD line is going away from 0, then it susually means the current momentum is gaining strength.
     *  On the other side when it's nearing 0, then the momentum is losing strength.
     *  Also When the MACD crosses the signal line from above, it's a good insight for a sell signal.
     *  When the MACD crosses the signal line from below, it's a good insight for a buy signal.
     *  Note: the standard values for MACD periods is 12,26,9 and this is what we suggest to use.
